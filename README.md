# CV-Project-2
This project is a statistical analysis of cryptocurrency data using SQL Server to demonstrate my skills. For this project I used ["Global Crypto Currency Price Database"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lasaljaywardena/global-cryptocurrency-price-database?resource=download) from Kaggle. This dataset contains data about over 7500 cryptocurrencies for the different periods of time and being constantly updated. In total there are more than five million rows of data, so I can't upload it here. To upload data into the SQL Server, I wrote a Python [script](https://github.com/Faleb/CV-Project-2/blob/main/Bulk%20insert%20to%20SQL%20Server.py) that uses T-SQL's BULK INSERT. Usually the Kaggle's datasets are already clean enough to work with, but I had to write a short [script](https://github.com/Faleb/CV-Project-2/blob/main/Volume%20fix.sql) to fix the volume column and remove spaces from values.
